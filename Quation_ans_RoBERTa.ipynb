It comes from Old French comunicacion (14c., Modern French communication), from Latin communicationem (nominative communication), noun of action from past participle stem of communicare, \"to share, divide out; communicate, impart, inform; join, unite, participate in,\" literally, \"to make common\", from communis\".[10] ADP is a Data Accelarated pipeline which helps to faster the data engineering process.
