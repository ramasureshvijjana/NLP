      "alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\n",
      "bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\n",
      "the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\n",
      "conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought alice\n",
      "“without pictures or conversations?”\n",
      "\n",
      "so she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\n",
      "hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\n",
      "making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\n",
      "picking the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran\n",
      "close by her.\n",
      "\n",
      "there was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did alice think it\n",
      "so _very_ much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself, “oh\n",
      "dear! oh dear! i shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,\n",
      "it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\n",
      "time it all seemed quite natural); but when the rabbit actually _took a\n",
      "watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\n",
      "on, alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\n",
      "had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\n",
      "watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\n",
      "field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\n",
      "large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n",
      "\n",
      "in another moment down went alice after it, never once considering how\n",
      "in the world she was to get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "the rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\n",
      "dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think\n",
      "about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\n",
      "deep well.\n",
      "\n",
      "either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\n",
      "plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\n",
      "was going to happen next. first, she tried to look down and make out\n",
      "what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\n",
      "looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\n",
      "cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\n",
      "hung upon pegs. she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\n",
      "passed; it was labelled “orange marmalade”, but to her great\n",
      "disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\n",
      "of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\n",
      "cupboards as she fell past it.\n",
      "\n",
      "“well!” thought alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, i shall\n",
      "think nothing of tumbling down stairs! how brave they’ll all think me\n",
      "at home! why, i wouldn’t say anything about it, even if i fell off the\n",
      "top of the house!” (which was very likely true.)\n",
      "\n",
      "down, down, down. would the fall _never_ come to an end? “i wonder how\n",
      "many miles i’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “i must be\n",
      "getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. let me see: that would\n",
      "be four thousand miles down, i think—” (for, you see, alice had learnt\n",
      "several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\n",
      "though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\n",
      "knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\n",
      "practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but\n",
      "then i wonder what latitude or longitude i’ve got to?” (alice had no\n",
      "idea what latitude was, or longitude either, but thought they were nice\n",
      "grand words to say.)\n",
      "\n",
      "presently she began again. “i wonder if i shall fall right _through_\n",
      "the earth! how funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk\n",
      "with their heads downward! the antipathies, i think—” (she was rather\n",
      "glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all\n",
      "the right word) “—but i shall have to ask them what the name of the\n",
      "country is, you know. please, ma’am, is this new zealand or australia?”\n",
      "(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re\n",
      "falling through the air! do you think you could manage it?) “and what\n",
      "an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! no, it’ll never do\n",
      "to ask: perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "down, down, down. there was nothing else to do, so alice soon began\n",
      "talking again. “dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, i should think!”\n",
      "(dinah was the cat.) “i hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at\n",
      "tea-time. dinah my dear! i wish you were down here with me! there are\n",
      "no mice in the air, i’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s\n",
      "very like a mouse, you know. but do cats eat bats, i wonder?” and here\n",
      "alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\n",
      "dreamy sort of way, “do cats eat bats? do cats eat bats?” and\n",
      "sometimes, “do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer\n",
      "either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. she felt\n",
      "that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\n",
      "walking hand in hand with dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\n",
      "“now, dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,\n",
      "thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\n",
      "the fall was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\n",
      "she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\n",
      "long passage, and the white rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\n",
      "it. there was not a moment to be lost: away went alice like the wind,\n",
      "and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “oh my ears\n",
      "and whiskers, how late it’s getting!” she was close behind it when she\n",
      "turned the corner, but the rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\n",
      "herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\n",
      "from the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "there were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\n",
      "alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\n",
      "door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\n",
      "get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\n",
      "glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and alice’s\n",
      "first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\n",
      "but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\n",
      "but at any rate it would not open any of them. however, on the second\n",
      "time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\n",
      "behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\n",
      "little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n",
      "\n",
      "alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\n",
      "much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\n",
      "passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. how she longed to get\n",
      "out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\n",
      "flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\n",
      "through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought\n",
      "poor alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. oh,\n",
      "how i wish i could shut up like a telescope! i think i could, if i only\n",
      "knew how to begin.” for, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\n",
      "happened lately, that alice had begun to think that very few things\n",
      "indeed were really impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\n",
      "back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\n",
      "any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\n",
      "time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here\n",
      "before,” said alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\n",
      "label, with the words “drink me,” beautifully printed on it in large\n",
      "letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "it was all very well to say “drink me,” but the wise little alice was\n",
      "not going to do _that_ in a hurry. “no, i’ll look first,” she said,\n",
      "“and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read\n",
      "several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\n",
      "eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\n",
      "_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\n",
      "such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\n",
      "and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\n",
      "bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\n",
      "bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,\n",
      "sooner or later.\n",
      "\n",
      "however, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so alice ventured to\n",
      "taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\n",
      "flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\n",
      "hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n",

      "\n",
      "and so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\n",
      "brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\n",
      "through the little door into that lovely garden. first, however, she\n",
      "waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\n",
      "she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”\n",

      "\n",
      "after a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\n",
      "into the garden at once; but, alas for poor alice! when she got to the\n",
      "door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\n",
      "went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\n",
      "it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\n",
      "best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\n",
      "and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\n",
      "sat down and cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said alice to herself,\n",
      "rather sharply; “i advise you to leave off this minute!” she generally\n",
      "gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\n",
      "and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\n",
      "her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\n",
      "cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\n",
      "for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\n",
      "“but it’s no use now,” thought poor alice, “to pretend to be two\n",
      "people! why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\n",
      "person!”\n",
      "\n",
      "soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\n",
      "she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\n",
      "“eat me” were beautifully marked in currants. “well, i’ll eat it,” said\n",
      "alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, i can reach the key; and if it\n",

      "\n",
      "she ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “which way? which\n",
      "way?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\n",
      "growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\n",
      "size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but alice\n",
      "had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\n",
      "things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\n",
      "on in the common way.\n",

      "sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\n",
      "of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) however, she\n",

      "\n",
      "just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\n",
      "off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\n",
      "it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\n",
      "she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\n",
      "slipped in like herself.\n",

      "of swimming about here, o mouse!” (alice thought this must be the right\n",
      "way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\n",
      "she remembered having seen in her brother’s latin grammar, “a mouse—of\n",
      "a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—o mouse!”) the mouse looked at her rather\n",
      "inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\n",
      "but it said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“perhaps it doesn’t understand english,” thought alice; “i daresay it’s\n",
      "a french mouse, come over with william the conqueror.” (for, with all\n",
      "her knowledge of history, alice had no very clear notion how long ago\n",
      "anything had happened.) so she began again: “où est ma chatte?” which\n",
      "was the first sentence in her french lesson-book. the mouse gave a\n",
      "sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\n",
      "fright. “oh, i beg your pardon!” cried alice hastily, afraid that she\n",
      "had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “i quite forgot you didn’t like\n",

      "\n",
      "“not like cats!” cried the mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “would\n",
      "_you_ like cats if you were me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“well, perhaps not,” said alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry\n",

      "take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. she is such a dear\n",
      "quiet thing,” alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\n",
      "in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\n",
      "paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to\n",
      "nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, i beg your\n",
      "pardon!” cried alice again, for this time the mouse was bristling all\n",
      "over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “we won’t talk\n",
      "about her any more if you’d rather not.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“we indeed!” cried the mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\n",

      "_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! don’t let me hear the name\n",
      "again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i won’t indeed!” said alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\n",
      "conversation. “are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” the mouse did not\n",
      "answer, so alice went on eagerly: “there is such a nice little dog near\n",

      "know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! and it’ll fetch things when\n",
      "you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\n",
      "of things—i can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you\n",

      "it kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried alice in a sorrowful tone,\n",
      "“i’m afraid i’ve offended it again!” for the mouse was swimming away\n",
      "from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\n",
      "pool as it went.\n",
      "\n",
      "so she called softly after it, “mouse dear! do come back again, and we\n",
      "won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” when the\n",
      "mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\n",
      "was quite pale (with passion, alice thought), and it said in a low\n",
      "trembling voice, “let us get to the shore, and then i’ll tell you my\n",
      "history, and you’ll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "it was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\n",

      "\n",
      "the first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\n",

      "one a-piece, all round.\n",
      "\n",
      "“but she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the mouse.\n",

      "\n",
      "“only a thimble,” said alice sadly.\n",
      "\n",

      "she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "the next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\n",
      "confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\n",
      "theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\n",
      "however, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\n",
      "begged the mouse to tell them something more.\n",
      "\n",
      "“you promised to tell me your history, you know,” said alice, “and why\n",

      "at the mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” and she kept on\n",
      "puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the\n",

      "\n",
      "         “fury said to a mouse, that he met in the house, ‘let us both\n",

      "anxiously about her. “oh, do let me help to undo it!”\n",

      "his fan and gloves—that is, if i can find them.” as she said this, she\n",
      "came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\n",
      "plate with the name “w. rabbit,” engraved upon it. she went in without\n",

      "gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\n",
      "little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. there was no label\n",
      "this time with the words “drink me,” but nevertheless she uncorked it\n",
      "and put it to her lips. “i know _something_ interesting is sure to\n",
      "happen,” she said to herself, “whenever i eat or drink anything; so\n",

      "\n",
      "it did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\n",
      "drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\n",

      "down the bottle, saying to herself “that’s quite enough—i hope i shan’t\n",
      "grow any more—as it is, i can’t get out at the door—i do wish i hadn’t\n",
      "drunk quite so much!”\n",
      "\n",
      "alas! it was too late to wish that! she went on growing, and growing,\n",
      "and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\n",
      "was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\n",
      "one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\n",
      "still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\n",
      "of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “now i\n",

      "seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\n",
      "again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“it was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor alice, “when one wasn’t\n",
      "always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\n",
      "rabbits. i almost wish i hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and\n",
      "yet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! i do wonder what\n",

      "sorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“but then,” thought alice, “shall i _never_ get any older than i am\n",
      "now? that’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but\n",

      "“oh, you foolish alice!” she answered herself. “how can you learn\n",

      "for any lesson-books!”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“mary ann! mary ann!” said the voice. “fetch me my gloves this moment!”\n",
      "then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. alice knew it was\n",
      "the rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\n",
      "house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\n",
      "large as the rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "presently the rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\n",
      "the door opened inwards, and alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,\n",
      "that attempt proved a failure. alice heard it say to itself “then i’ll\n",
      "go round and get in at the window.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_that_ you won’t!” thought alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\n",
      "she heard the rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\n",
      "hand, and made a snatch in the air. she did not get hold of anything,\n",
      "but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\n",
      "from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\n",
      "cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "next came an angry voice—the rabbit’s—“pat! pat! where are you?” and\n",

      "for apples, yer honour!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“digging for apples, indeed!” said the rabbit angrily. “here! come and\n",
      "help me out of _this!_” (sounds of more broken glass.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“now tell me, pat, what’s that in the window?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (he pronounced it “arrum.”)\n",
      "\n",
      "“an arm, you goose! who ever saw one that size? why, it fills the whole\n",
      "window!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”\n",
      "\n",
      "there was a long silence after this, and alice could only hear whispers\n",
      "now and then; such as, “sure, i don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at\n",
      "all!” “do as i tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her\n",
      "hand again, and made another snatch in the air. this time there were\n",
      "_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “what a number\n",
      "of cucumber-frames there must be!” thought alice. “i wonder what\n",
      "they’ll do next! as for pulling me out of the window, i only wish they\n",
      "_could!_ i’m sure _i_ don’t want to stay in here any longer!”\n",
      "\n",
      "she waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\n",
      "rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\n",
      "talking together: she made out the words: “where’s the other\n",
      "ladder?—why, i hadn’t to bring but one; bill’s got the other—bill!\n",
      "fetch it here, lad!—here, put ’em up at this corner—no, tie ’em\n",

      "heads below!” (a loud crash)—“now, who did that?—it was bill, i\n",
      "fancy—who’s to go down the chimney?—nay, _i_ shan’t! _you_ do\n",
      "it!—_that_ i won’t, then!—bill’s to go down—here, bill! the master says\n",
      "you’re to go down the chimney!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“oh! so bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said alice to\n",
      "herself. “shy, they seem to put everything upon bill! i wouldn’t be in\n",
      "bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\n",
      "i _think_ i can kick a little!”\n",
      "\n",
      "she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\n",

      "saying to herself “this is bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited\n",
      "to see what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "the first thing she heard was a general chorus of “there goes bill!”\n",
      "then the rabbit’s voice along—“catch him, you by the hedge!” then\n",
      "silence, and then another confusion of voices—“hold up his head—brandy\n",
      "now—don’t choke him—how was it, old fellow? what happened to you? tell\n",
      "us all about it!”\n",
      "\n",
      "last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“that’s bill,” thought\n",
      "alice,) “well, i hardly know—no more, thank ye; i’m better now—but i’m\n",
      "a deal too flustered to tell you—all i know is, something comes at me\n",
      "like a jack-in-the-box, and up i goes like a sky-rocket!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“so you did, old fellow!” said the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "“we must burn the house down!” said the rabbit’s voice; and alice\n",
      "called out as loud as she could, “if you do, i’ll set dinah at you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "there was a dead silence instantly, and alice thought to herself, “i\n",
      "wonder what they _will_ do next! if they had any sense, they’d take the\n",
      "roof off.” after a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\n",
      "alice heard the rabbit say, “a barrowful will do, to begin with.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“a barrowful of _what?_” thought alice; but she had not long to doubt,\n",
      "for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\n",
      "window, and some of them hit her in the face. “i’ll put a stop to\n",
      "this,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “you’d better not do that\n",
      "again!” which produced another dead silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\n",
      "little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\n",
      "head. “if i eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make\n",
      "_some_ change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it\n",
      "must make me smaller, i suppose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "so she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\n",
      "began shrinking directly. as soon as she was small enough to get\n",
      "through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\n",
      "little animals and birds waiting outside. the poor little lizard, bill,\n",
      "was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\n",
      "something out of a bottle. they all made a rush at alice the moment she\n",
      "appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\n",
      "safe in a thick wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "“the first thing i’ve got to do,” said alice to herself, as she\n",
      "wandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the\n",
      "second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. i think that\n",
      "will be the best plan.”\n",
      "\n",
      "it sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\n",
      "arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\n",
      "how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\n",
      "the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\n",
      "great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\n",
      "feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “poor little\n",
      "thing!” said alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\n",
      "it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\n",
      "might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\n",
      "spite of all her coaxing.\n",
      "\n",
      "hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\n",
      "held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\n",
      "all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\n",
      "and made believe to worry it; then alice dodged behind a great thistle,\n",
      "to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\n",
      "other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\n",
      "over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then alice, thinking it was\n",
      "very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\n",
      "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\n",
      "the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\n",
      "little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\n",
      "all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\n",
      "its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\n",
      "set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\n",
      "and till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“and yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said alice, as she leant\n",
      "against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\n",
      "leaves: “i should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if i’d\n",
      "only been the right size to do it! oh dear! i’d nearly forgotten that\n",
      "i’ve got to grow up again! let me see—how _is_ it to be managed? i\n",
      "suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\n",
      "question is, what?”\n",
      "\n",
      "the great question certainly was, what? alice looked all round her at\n",
      "the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\n",
      "looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\n",
      "there was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\n",
      "herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\n",
      "behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\n",
      "was on the top of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "she stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\n",
      "mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\n",
      "caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly\n",
      "smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of\n",

      "addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“who are _you?_” said the caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. alice replied,\n",
      "rather shyly, “i—i hardly know, sir, just at present—at least i know\n",
      "who i _was_ when i got up this morning, but i think i must have been\n",
      "changed several times since then.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“what do you mean by that?” said the caterpillar sternly. “explain\n",
      "yourself!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i can’t explain _myself_, i’m afraid, sir,” said alice, “because i’m\n",

      "\n",
      "“i’m afraid i can’t put it more clearly,” alice replied very politely,\n",
      "“for i can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\n",
      "different sizes in a day is very confusing.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“it isn’t,” said the caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "“well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said alice; “but when you\n",
      "have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then\n",
      "after that into a butterfly, i should think you’ll feel it a little\n",
      "queer, won’t you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“not a bit,” said the caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",

      "is, it would feel very queer to _me_.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“you!” said the caterpillar contemptuously. “who are _you?_”\n",
      "\n",
      "which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\n",
      "alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar’s making such _very_\n",
      "short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “i\n",
      "think, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“why?” said the caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "here was another puzzling question; and as alice could not think of any\n",
      "good reason, and as the caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\n",
      "state of mind, she turned away.\n",
      "\n",

      "could.\n",
      "\n",
      "“no,” said the caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\n",
      "and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. for\n",
      "some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\n",
      "its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “so you\n",
      "think you’re changed, do you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i’m afraid i am, sir,” said alice; “i can’t remember things as i\n",

      "“can’t remember _what_ things?” said the caterpillar.\n",

      "\n",
      "“what size do you want to be?” it asked.\n",

      "\n",
      "“and now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\n",
      "the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a\n",

      "\n",
      "she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\n",
      "that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\n",
      "set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. her chin was pressed\n",
      "so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\n",
      "mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\n",
      "lefthand bit.\n",

      "were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\n",
      "an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\n",
      "sea of green leaves that lay far below her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“what _can_ all that green stuff be?” said alice. “and where _have_ my\n",

      "she was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\n",
      "except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\n",
      "she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\n",
      "her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. she\n",
      "had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\n",
      "going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\n",
      "the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\n",
      "hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\n",
      "face, and was beating her violently with its wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "“serpent!” screamed the pigeon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“i’m _not_ a serpent!” said alice indignantly. “let me alone!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“serpent, i say again!” repeated the pigeon, but in a more subdued\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\n",
      "saying anything more till the pigeon had finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "“as if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the pigeon;\n",
      "“but i must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! why, i\n",
      "haven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said alice, who was beginning to\n",
      "see its meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "“and just as i’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the\n",
      "pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as i was thinking i\n",
      "should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\n",
      "from the sky! ugh, serpent!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“but i’m _not_ a serpent, i tell you!” said alice. “i’m a—i’m a—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“well! _what_ are you?” said the pigeon. “i can see you’re trying to\n",
      "invent something!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i—i’m a little girl,” said alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\n",
      "the number of changes she had gone through that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "“a likely story indeed!” said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest\n",
      "contempt. “i’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\n",
      "_one_ with such a neck as that! no, no! you’re a serpent; and there’s\n",
      "no use denying it. i suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never\n",
      "tasted an egg!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said alice, who was a very truthful\n",
      "child; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\n",
      "know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i don’t believe it,” said the pigeon; “but if they do, why then\n",
      "they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all i can say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "this was such a new idea to alice, that she was quite silent for a\n",
      "minute or two, which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding, “you’re\n",
      "looking for eggs, i know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to\n",
      "me whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“it matters a good deal to _me_,” said alice hastily; “but i’m not\n",
      "looking for eggs, as it happens; and if i was, i shouldn’t want\n",
      "_yours_: i don’t like them raw.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“well, be off, then!” said the pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\n",
      "down again into its nest. alice crouched down among the trees as well\n",
      "as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\n",
      "and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. after a while\n",
      "she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\n",
      "and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\n",
      "the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\n",
      "she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\n",
      "\n",
      "it was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\n",
      "felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\n",
      "and began talking to herself, as usual. “come, there’s half my plan\n",
      "done now! how puzzling all these changes are! i’m never sure what i’m\n",
      "going to be, from one minute to another! however, i’ve got back to my\n",
      "right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how\n",
      "_is_ that to be done, i wonder?” as she said this, she came suddenly\n",
      "upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\n",
      "“whoever lives there,” thought alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them\n",
      "_this_ size: why, i should frighten them out of their wits!” so she\n",
      "began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go\n",
      "near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "chapter vi.\n",
      "pig and pepper\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "for a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\n",
      "to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\n",
      "wood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\n",
      "otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\n",
      "fish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. it was opened by\n",
      "another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\n",
      "frog; and both footmen, alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\n",
      "all over their heads. she felt very curious to know what it was all\n",
      "about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "the fish-footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\n",
      "nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\n",
      "saying, in a solemn tone, “for the duchess. an invitation from the\n",
      "queen to play croquet.” the frog-footman repeated, in the same solemn\n",
      "tone, only changing the order of the words a little, “from the queen.\n",
      "an invitation for the duchess to play croquet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\n",
      "for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\n",
      "fish-footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\n",
      "door, staring stupidly up into the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“there’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the footman, “and that for\n",
      "two reasons. first, because i’m on the same side of the door as you\n",
      "are; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could\n",
      "possibly hear you.” and certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\n",
      "noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now\n",
      "and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\n",
      "pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "“please, then,” said alice, “how am i to get in?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“there might be some sense in your knocking,” the footman went on\n",
      "without attending to her, “if we had the door between us. for instance,\n",
      "if you were _inside_, you might knock, and i could let you out, you\n",
      "know.” he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\n",
      "this alice thought decidedly uncivil. “but perhaps he can’t help it,”\n",
      "she said to herself; “his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\n",
      "head. but at any rate he might answer questions.—how am i to get in?”\n",
      "she repeated, aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“i shall sit here,” the footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”\n",
      "\n",
      "at this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\n",
      "skimming out, straight at the footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,\n",
      "and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—or next day, maybe,” the footman continued in the same tone, exactly\n",
      "as if nothing had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "“how am i to get in?” asked alice again, in a louder tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“_are_ you to get in at all?” said the footman. “that’s the first\n",
      "question, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "it was, no doubt: only alice did not like to be told so. “it’s really\n",
      "dreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue.\n",
      "it’s enough to drive one crazy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\n",
      "remark, with variations. “i shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for\n",
      "days and days.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“but what am _i_ to do?” said alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“anything you like,” said the footman, and began whistling.\n",
      "\n",
      "“oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said alice desperately: “he’s\n",
      "perfectly idiotic!” and she opened the door and went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "the door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\n",
      "one end to the other: the duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool\n",
      "in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,\n",
      "stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "“there’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” alice said to\n",
      "herself, as well as she could for sneezing.\n",
      "\n",
      "there was certainly too much of it in the air. even the duchess sneezed\n",
      "occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\n",
      "alternately without a moment’s pause. the only things in the kitchen\n",
      "that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\n",
      "on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“please would you tell me,” said alice, a little timidly, for she was\n",
      "not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why\n",
      "your cat grins like that?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“it’s a cheshire cat,” said the duchess, “and that’s why. pig!”\n",
      "\n",
      "she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite\n",
      "jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\n",
      "baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“i didn’t know that cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, i didn’t\n",
      "know that cats _could_ grin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“they all can,” said the duchess; “and most of ’em do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i don’t know of any that do,” alice said very politely, feeling quite\n",
      "pleased to have got into a conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“you don’t know much,” said the duchess; “and that’s a fact.”\n",
      "\n",
      "alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\n",
      "be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. while she\n",
      "was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\n",
      "fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\n",
      "the duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a\n",
      "shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. the duchess took no notice of\n",
      "them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\n",
      "that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "“oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!” cried alice, jumping up and down\n",
      "in an agony of terror. “oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!” as an\n",
      "unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\n",
      "off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“if everybody minded their own business,” the duchess said in a hoarse\n",
      "growl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“which would _not_ be an advantage,” said alice, who felt very glad to\n",
      "get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “just\n",
      "think of what work it would make with the day and night! you see the\n",
      "earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“talking of axes,” said the duchess, “chop off her head!”\n",
      "\n",
      "alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\n",
      "the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\n",
      "be listening, so she went on again: “twenty-four hours, i _think_; or\n",
      "is it twelve? i—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“oh, don’t bother _me_,” said the duchess; “i never could abide\n",
      "figures!” and with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\n",
      "sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\n",
      "the end of every line:\n",
      "\n",
      "“speak roughly to your little boy,\n",
      "    and beat him when he sneezes:\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "while the duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\n",

      "that alice could hardly hear the words:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“i speak severely to my boy,\n",

      "\n",
      "alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\n",
      "little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,\n",
      "“just like a star-fish,” thought alice. the poor little thing was\n",
      "snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\n",
      "itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\n",
      "the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "the baby grunted again, and alice looked very anxiously into its face\n",
      "to see what was the matter with it. there could be no doubt that it had\n",
      "a _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\n",
      "its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether alice did\n",
      "not like the look of the thing at all. “but perhaps it was only\n",

      "were any tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "no, there were no tears. “if you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,”\n",

      "now!” the poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\n",
      "to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice was just beginning to think to herself, “now, what am i to do\n",

      "violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. this time\n",
      "there could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\n",
      "a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\n",
      "further.\n",
      "\n",
      "so she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\n",
      "trot away quietly into the wood. “if it had grown up,” she said to\n",
      "herself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\n",
      "rather a handsome pig, i think.” and she began thinking over other\n",

      "to herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she\n",
      "was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of\n",
      "a tree a few yards off.\n",
      "\n",
      "the cat only grinned when it saw alice. it looked good-natured, she\n",

      "“then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the cat.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“your hair wants cutting,” said the hatter. he had been looking at\n",

      "say—that’s the same thing, you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“not the same thing a bit!” said the hatter. “you might just as well\n",

      "“you might just as well say,” added the dormouse, who seemed to be\n",

      "as ‘i sleep when i breathe’!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“it _is_ the same thing with you,” said the hatter, and here the\n",
      "conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\n",
      "alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\n",
      "writing-desks, which wasn’t much.\n",
      "\n",
      "the hatter was the first to break the silence. “what day of the month\n",

      "and holding it to his ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice considered a little, and then said “the fourth.”\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“it was the _best_ butter,” the march hare meekly replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the hatter grumbled:\n",
      "“you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.”\n",
      "\n",
      "the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\n",
      "it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\n",

      "you know.”\n",
      "\n",
      "alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “what a\n",

      "sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly english. “i don’t quite\n",

      "\n",
      "“the dormouse is asleep again,” said the hatter, and he poured a little\n",
      "hot tea upon its nose.\n",

      "do a thing i ask! it’s always six o’clock now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "a bright idea came into alice’s head. “is that the reason so many\n",

      "they pinched it on both sides at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "the dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “i wasn’t asleep,” he said in a\n",

      "“very,” said alice: “—where’s the duchess?”\n",

      "“hush! hush!” said the rabbit in a low, hurried tone. he looked\n",
      "anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\n",
      "tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “she’s under\n",

      "‘what for?’”\n",

      "“she boxed the queen’s ears—” the rabbit began. alice gave a little\n",
      "scream of laughter. “oh, hush!” the rabbit whispered in a frightened\n",
      "tone. “the queen will hear you! you see, she came rather late, and the\n",
      "queen said—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“get to your places!” shouted the queen in a voice of thunder, and\n",
      "people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\n",
      "other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\n",
      "began. alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground\n",
      "in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live\n",
      "hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\n",
      "themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\n",
      "\n",
      "the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\n",
      "she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,\n",
      "under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\n",
      "had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the\n",
      "hedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look\n",
      "up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\n",
      "bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was\n",
      "going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog\n",
      "had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all\n",
      "this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\n",
      "wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\n",
      "always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, alice\n",
      "soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "the players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\n",
      "all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time\n",
      "the queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\n",
      "shouting “off with his head!” or “off with her head!” about once in a\n",
      "minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\n",
      "dispute with the queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\n",
      "“and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? they’re dreadfully\n",
      "fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any\n",
      "one left alive!”\n",
      "\n",
      "she was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\n",
      "could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\n",
      "appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\n",
      "watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\n",
      "to herself “it’s the cheshire cat: now i shall have somebody to talk\n",
      "to.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“how are you getting on?” said the cat, as soon as there was mouth\n",
      "enough for it to speak with.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “it’s no use\n",
      "speaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one\n",
      "of them.” in another minute the whole head appeared, and then alice put\n",
      "down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\n",
      "she had someone to listen to her. the cat seemed to think that there\n",
      "was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "“i don’t think they play at all fairly,” alice began, in rather a\n",
      "complaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear\n",
      "oneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at\n",
      "least, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how\n",
      "confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the\n",
      "arch i’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\n",
      "ground—and i should have croqueted the queen’s hedgehog just now, only\n",
      "it ran away when it saw mine coming!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“how do you like the queen?” said the cat in a low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“not at all,” said alice: “she’s so extremely—” just then she noticed\n",
      "that the queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\n",
      "“—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”\n",
      "\n",
      "the queen smiled and passed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“who _are_ you talking to?” said the king, going up to alice, and\n",
      "looking at the cat’s head with great curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "“it’s a friend of mine—a cheshire cat,” said alice: “allow me to\n",
      "introduce it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i don’t like the look of it at all,” said the king: “however, it may\n",
      "kiss my hand if it likes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i’d rather not,” the cat remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“don’t be impertinent,” said the king, “and don’t look at me like\n",
      "that!” he got behind alice as he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“a cat may look at a king,” said alice. “i’ve read that in some book,\n",
      "but i don’t remember where.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“well, it must be removed,” said the king very decidedly, and he called\n",
      "the queen, who was passing at the moment, “my dear! i wish you would\n",
      "have this cat removed!”\n",
      "\n",
      "the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or\n",
      "small. “off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.\n",
      "\n",
      "“i’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the king eagerly, and he\n",
      "hurried off.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\n",
      "on, as she heard the queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with\n",
      "passion. she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\n",
      "executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\n",
      "of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\n",
      "whether it was her turn or not. so she went in search of her hedgehog.\n",
      "\n",
      "the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\n",
      "to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\n",
      "other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\n",
      "the other side of the garden, where alice could see it trying in a\n",
      "helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\n",
      "was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t\n",
      "matter much,” thought alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side\n",
      "of the ground.” so she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\n",
      "escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\n",
      "friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "when she got back to the cheshire cat, she was surprised to find quite\n",
      "a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\n",
      "the executioner, the king, and the queen, who were all talking at once,\n",
      "while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "the moment alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\n",
      "the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\n",
      "all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\n",
      "what they said.\n",
      "\n",
      "the executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless\n",

      "thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at _his_ time of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "the king’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\n",
      "beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.\n",
      "\n",
      "the queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in\n",
      "less than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (it was\n",

      "\n",
      "the cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the\n",

      "“you can’t think how glad i am to see you again, you dear old thing!”\n",
      "said the duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into alice’s,\n",
      "and they walked off together.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\n",
      "to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\n",
      "savage when they met in the kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“when _i’m_ a duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful\n",
      "tone though), “i won’t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. soup\n",
      "does very well without—maybe it’s always pepper that makes people\n",
      "hot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new\n",
      "kind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes\n",
      "them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children\n",
      "sweet-tempered. i only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn’t be\n",
      "so stingy about it, you know—”\n",
      "\n",
      "she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time, and was a little\n",
      "startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “you’re thinking\n",
      "about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. i can’t\n",
      "tell you just now what the moral of that is, but i shall remember it in\n",
      "a bit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“perhaps it hasn’t one,” alice ventured to remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "“tut, tut, child!” said the duchess. “everything’s got a moral, if only\n",
      "you can find it.” and she squeezed herself up closer to alice’s side as\n",
      "she spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\n",
      "duchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\n",
      "right height to rest her chin upon alice’s shoulder, and it was an\n",
      "uncomfortably sharp chin. however, she did not like to be rude, so she\n",
      "bore it as well as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "“the game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up\n",
      "the conversation a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "“’tis so,” said the duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘oh, ’tis love,\n",
      "’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“somebody said,” alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding\n",
      "their own business!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“ah, well! it means much the same thing,” said the duchess, digging her\n",
      "sharp little chin into alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of\n",
      "_that_ is—‘take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\n",
      "themselves.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“how fond she is of finding morals in things!” alice thought to\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "“i dare say you’re wondering why i don’t put my arm round your waist,”\n",
      "the duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that i’m doubtful about\n",
      "the temper of your flamingo. shall i try the experiment?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“he might bite,” alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious\n",
      "to have the experiment tried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“very true,” said the duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. and\n",
      "the moral of that is—‘birds of a feather flock together.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“only mustard isn’t a bird,” alice remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“right, as usual,” said the duchess: “what a clear way you have of\n",
      "putting things!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“it’s a mineral, i _think_,” said alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“of course it is,” said the duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\n",
      "everything that alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here.\n",
      "and the moral of that is—‘the more there is of mine, the less there is\n",
      "of yours.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“oh, i know!” exclaimed alice, who had not attended to this last\n",
      "remark, “it’s a vegetable. it doesn’t look like one, but it is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i quite agree with you,” said the duchess; “and the moral of that\n",
      "is—‘be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more\n",
      "simply—‘never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\n",
      "appear to others that what you were or might have been was not\n",
      "otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\n",
      "otherwise.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i think i should understand that better,” alice said very politely,\n",
      "“if i had it written down: but i can’t quite follow it as you say it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“that’s nothing to what i could say if i chose,” the duchess replied,\n",
      "in a pleased tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said\n",
      "alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the duchess. “i make you a present\n",
      "of everything i’ve said as yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“a cheap sort of present!” thought alice. “i’m glad they don’t give\n",
      "birthday presents like that!” but she did not venture to say it out\n",
      "loud.\n",
      "\n",
      "“thinking again?” the duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\n",
      "little chin.\n",
      "\n",
      "“i’ve a right to think,” said alice sharply, for she was beginning to\n",
      "feel a little worried.\n",
      "\n",
      "“just about as much right,” said the duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and\n",
      "the m—”\n",
      "\n",
      "but here, to alice’s great surprise, the duchess’s voice died away,\n",
      "even in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was\n",
      "linked into hers began to tremble. alice looked up, and there stood the\n",
      "queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a\n",
      "thunderstorm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“a fine day, your majesty!” the duchess began in a low, weak voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“now, i give you fair warning,” shouted the queen, stamping on the\n",
      "ground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in\n",
      "about half no time! take your choice!”\n",
      "\n",
      "the duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“let’s go on with the game,” the queen said to alice; and alice was too\n",
      "much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\n",
      "croquet-ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "the other guests had taken advantage of the queen’s absence, and were\n",
      "resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\n",
      "back to the game, the queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay\n",
      "would cost them their lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling\n",
      "with the other players, and shouting “off with his head!” or “off with\n",
      "her head!” those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the\n",
      "soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so\n",
      "that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and\n",
      "all the players, except the king, the queen, and alice, were in custody\n",
      "and under sentence of execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "then the queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to alice, “have\n",
      "you seen the mock turtle yet?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“no,” said alice. “i don’t even know what a mock turtle is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“it’s the thing mock turtle soup is made from,” said the queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“i never saw one, or heard of one,” said alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“come on, then,” said the queen, “and he shall tell you his history,”\n",
      "\n",
      "as they walked off together, alice heard the king say in a low voice,\n",
      "to the company generally, “you are all pardoned.” “come, _that’s_ a\n",
      "good thing!” she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\n",
      "number of executions the queen had ordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "they very soon came upon a gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (if\n",
      "you don’t know what a gryphon is, look at the picture.) “up, lazy\n",
      "thing!” said the queen, “and take this young lady to see the mock\n",
      "turtle, and to hear his history. i must go back and see after some\n",
      "executions i have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving alice alone\n",
      "with the gryphon. alice did not quite like the look of the creature,\n",
      "but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it\n",
      "as to go after that savage queen: so she waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the queen till\n",
      "she was out of sight: then it chuckled. “what fun!” said the gryphon,\n",
      "half to itself, half to alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“what _is_ the fun?” said alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“why, _she_,” said the gryphon. “it’s all her fancy, that: they never\n",
      "executes nobody, you know. come on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought alice, as she went slowly\n",
      "after it: “i never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”\n",
      "\n",
      "they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance,\n",
      "sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\n",
      "nearer, alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. she\n",
      "pitied him deeply. “what is his sorrow?” she asked the gryphon, and the\n",
      "gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “it’s all\n",
      "his fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. come on!”\n",
      "\n",
      "so they went up to the mock turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\n",
      "full of tears, but said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“this here young lady,” said the gryphon, “she wants for to know your\n",
      "history, she do.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i’ll tell it her,” said the mock turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit\n",
      "down, both of you, and don’t speak a word till i’ve finished.”\n",
      "\n",
      "so they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. alice thought to\n",
      "herself, “i don’t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn’t begin.”\n",
      "but she waited patiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "“once,” said the mock turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “i was a real\n",
      "turtle.”\n",
      "\n",
      "these words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\n",
      "occasional exclamation of “hjckrrh!” from the gryphon, and the constant\n",
      "heavy sobbing of the mock turtle. alice was very nearly getting up and\n",
      "saying, “thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not\n",
      "help thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "“when we were little,” the mock turtle went on at last, more calmly,\n",
      "though still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the\n",
      "sea. the master was an old turtle—we used to call him tortoise—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“why did you call him tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” alice asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“we called him tortoise because he taught us,” said the mock turtle\n",
      "angrily: “really you are very dull!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\n",
      "question,” added the gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked\n",
      "at poor alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. at last the\n",
      "gryphon said to the mock turtle, “drive on, old fellow! don’t be all\n",
      "day about it!” and he went on in these words:\n",
      "\n",
      "“yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i never said i didn’t!” interrupted alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“you did,” said the mock turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“hold your tongue!” added the gryphon, before alice could speak again.\n",
      "the mock turtle went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“we had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_i’ve_ been to a day-school, too,” said alice; “you needn’t be so\n",
      "proud as all that.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“with extras?” asked the mock turtle a little anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "“yes,” said alice, “we learned french and music.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“and washing?” said the mock turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“certainly not!” said alice indignantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the mock turtle in a\n",
      "tone of great relief. “now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,\n",
      "‘french, music, _and washing_—extra.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“you couldn’t have wanted it much,” said alice; “living at the bottom\n",
      "of the sea.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i couldn’t afford to learn it.” said the mock turtle with a sigh. “i\n",
      "only took the regular course.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“what was that?” inquired alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“reeling and writhing, of course, to begin with,” the mock turtle\n",
      "replied; “and then the different branches of arithmetic—ambition,\n",
      "distraction, uglification, and derision.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i never heard of ‘uglification,’” alice ventured to say. “what is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. “what! never heard of\n",
      "uglifying!” it exclaimed. “you know what to beautify is, i suppose?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“yes,” said alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“well, then,” the gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify\n",
      "is, you _are_ a simpleton.”\n",
      "\n",
      "alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so\n",
      "she turned to the mock turtle, and said “what else had you to learn?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“well, there was mystery,” the mock turtle replied, counting off the\n",
      "subjects on his flappers, “—mystery, ancient and modern, with\n",
      "seaography: then drawling—the drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\n",
      "that used to come once a week: _he_ taught us drawling, stretching, and\n",
      "fainting in coils.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“what was _that_ like?” said alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“well, i can’t show it you myself,” the mock turtle said: “i’m too\n",
      "stiff. and the gryphon never learnt it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“hadn’t time,” said the gryphon: “i went to the classics master,\n",
      "though. he was an old crab, _he_ was.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“i never went to him,” the mock turtle said with a sigh: “he taught\n",
      "laughing and grief, they used to say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“so he did, so he did,” said the gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\n",
      "creatures hid their faces in their paws.\n",
      "\n",
      "“and how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said alice, in a hurry\n",
      "to change the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "“ten hours the first day,” said the mock turtle: “nine the next, and so\n",
      "on.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“what a curious plan!” exclaimed alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“that’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the gryphon remarked:\n",
      "“because they lessen from day to day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "this was quite a new idea to alice, and she thought it over a little\n",
      "before she made her next remark. “then the eleventh day must have been\n",
      "a holiday?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“of course it was,” said the mock turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“and how did you manage on the twelfth?” alice went on eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“that’s enough about lessons,” the gryphon interrupted in a very\n",
      "decided tone: “tell her something about the games now.”\n",

      "the lobster quadrille\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the mock turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\n",
      "his eyes. he looked at alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\n",
      "two sobs choked his voice. “same as if he had a bone in his throat,”\n",
      "said the gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\n",
      "the back. at last the mock turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\n",
      "running down his cheeks, he went on again:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“you may not have lived much under the sea—” (“i haven’t,” said\n",
      "alice)—“and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—”\n",
      "(alice began to say “i once tasted—” but checked herself hastily, and\n",
      "said “no, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\n",
      "lobster quadrille is!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“no, indeed,” said alice. “what sort of a dance is it?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“why,” said the gryphon, “you first form into a line along the\n",
      "sea-shore—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“two lines!” cried the mock turtle. “seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\n",
      "then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_that_ generally takes some time,” interrupted the gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—you advance twice—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“of course,” the mock turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“then, you know,” the mock turtle went on, “you throw the—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“the lobsters!” shouted the gryphon, with a bound into the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "“—as far out to sea as you can—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“swim after them!” screamed the gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "“turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the mock turtle, capering wildly\n",
      "about.\n",
      "\n",
      "“change lobsters again!” yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the mock\n",
      "turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had\n",
      "been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very\n",
      "sadly and quietly, and looked at alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“it must be a very pretty dance,” said alice timidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“would you like to see a little of it?” said the mock turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“very much indeed,” said alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "“come, let’s try the first figure!” said the mock turtle to the\n",
      "gryphon. “we can do without lobsters, you know. which shall sing?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“oh, _you_ sing,” said the gryphon. “i’ve forgotten the words.”\n",
      "\n",
      "so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice, every now and\n",
      "then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\n",
      "forepaws to mark the time, while the mock turtle sang this, very slowly\n",
      "and sadly:—\n",
      "\n",
      "“will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.\n",
      "“there’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.\n",
      "see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\n",
      "they are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?\n",
      "will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?\n",
      "will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?\n",
      "\n",
      "“you can really have no notion how delightful it will be\n",
      "when they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”\n",
      "but the snail replied “too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—\n",

      "hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. in the very middle of the\n",
      "court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so\n",
      "good, that it made alice quite hungry to look at them—“i wish they’d\n",

      "about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\n",

      "herself, “because of his great wig.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“and that’s the jury-box,” thought alice, “and those twelve creatures,”\n",
      "(she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were\n",
      "animals, and some were birds,) “i suppose they are the jurors.” she\n",
      "said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather\n",
      "proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little\n",

      "at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he\n",

      "just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\n",

      "all this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter, and,\n",
      "just as the dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\n",

      "got it out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies much,” she\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "“who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen.\n",
      "\n",

      "nothing written on the _outside_.” he unfolded the paper as he spoke,\n",
      "and added “it isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.”\n",

      "“are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another of the jurymen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“no, they’re not,” said the white rabbit, “and that’s the queerest\n",

      "\n",
      "“he must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the king. (the jury\n",

      "\n",
      "“please your majesty,” said the knave, “i didn’t write it, and they\n",

      "\n",
      "“if you didn’t sign it,” said the king, “that only makes the matter\n",

      "your name like an honest man.”\n",
      "\n",
      "there was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\n",

      "trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. and yet i don’t\n",
      "know,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at\n",
      "them with one eye; “i seem to see some meaning in them, after all.\n",

      "\n",
      "the knave shook his head sadly. “do i look like it?” he said. (which he\n",
      "certainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“all right, so far,” said the king, and he went on muttering over the\n",
      "verses to himself: “‘_we know it to be true_—’ that’s the jury, of\n",
      "course—‘_i gave her one, they gave him two_—’ why, that must be what he\n",

      "tarts on the table. “nothing can be clearer than _that_. then\n",
      "again—‘_before she had this fit_—’ you never had fits, my dear, i\n",
      "think?” he said to the queen.\n",
      "\n",

      "began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long\n",
      "as it lasted.)\n",
      "\n",
      "“then the words don’t _fit_ you,” said the king, looking round the\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "at this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\n",

      "tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\n",
      "head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\n",
      "leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "“wake up, alice dear!” said her sister; “why, what a long sleep you’ve\n",

      "adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she\n",
      "had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “it _was_ a curious\n",
      "dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.”\n",
      "so alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\n",
      "what a wonderful dream it had been.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "but her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\n",
      "hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little alice and all\n",
      "her wonderful adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\n",
      "and this was her dream:—\n",
      "\n",
      "first, she dreamed of little alice herself, and once again the tiny\n",
      "hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\n",
      "looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and\n",
      "see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\n",
      "that _would_ always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or\n",
      "seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\n",
      "strange creatures of her little sister’s dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by—the\n",
      "frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she\n",
      "could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends\n",
      "shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the queen\n",
      "ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby\n",
      "was sneezing on the duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed\n",
      "around it—once more the shriek of the gryphon, the squeaking of the\n",
      "lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\n",
      "filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock\n",
      "turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "so she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\n",
      "wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\n",
      "would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the\n",
      "wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling\n",
      "teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the queen’s shrill\n",
      "cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the\n",
      "shriek of the gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change\n",
      "(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the\n",
